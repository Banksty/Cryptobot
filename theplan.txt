SHORT PLAN:
1. get sim working with changes we made. I.e. orderbook rather than tick. 
2. speed up our simulation, by how we are iterating over the data
2a). do more visualisation of the market structure, to gain better understanding. 
3. simulate the queue. This is so that if someone has an order in front of ours, we simulate that they get filled before ours (they have priority). 
4. train model again. See how well it goes. 
5. learn some maths, expected value & utility. 
6. new model. We will use a discretization regime to give the bot a number of choices, and it will choose the option with the best expected value. 
7. simulated experiments on model variables. (Like we did before, e.g. gamma). 
8. out-of-sample testing. This means we do a simulation but on NEW data, that was not used to train the model. This is an important step in test the true efficacy of the model.
9. step up an environment in the cloud, to run simulations & live "paper" trading. 
10. do some larger scale experiments. 
11. try our framework on data from a different exchange: Binance
13. deep revision of model & more experiments. 
12. consider actual live trading
